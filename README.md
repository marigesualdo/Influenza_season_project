# Influenza_season_project
Tableau Presentation and Reflections PDF from the project "Preparing for the Influenza Season in the USA"
Every year the Influenza season comes in USA and it is very important to organize how to send medical staff for each state in need.
Using epidemiological data from the CDC ( Center of Control and Diseases) and from the Data Sensus Bureau a plan was made to show when is the Influenza season in each state, which
people groups are mostly in danger, specially elderly, and which states need more medical staff.
With a collection of charts and maps the presentation was made using Tablau software and a video explanation link is also attached with the pdf document.
